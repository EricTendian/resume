            <strong>Co-Founder</strong>
            <p>2014 - Present</p>
            <p>Clarify is a platform which provides students a rich set of unique data insights while digitally connecting them directly with their advisors to bring students full transparency in order to register for the right courses that fit their passion and competence.
--
Students lack the clarity they need when registering for courses so they spend too much time on registration &amp; choose the wrong courses which don’t fit their major, passion, or competencies. This causes them to have a bad experience in those courses, potentially leading to failure and dropping out. In other cases, some students who apply for graduation cannot graduate because they are missing credit for a few courses that were overlooked. This leads to late graduations and more tuition expenses. 

Clarify&#39;s platform helps students choose courses that match their passion, major, and advisor’s feedback by providing them with intelligent and data-driven course suggestions. Students can log onto the platform, select their school, and automatically import their transcript to see recommendations on which courses to take next.</p>
